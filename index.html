        <p>
          ICT is also used to refer to the convergence of audiovisuals and
          telephone networks with computer networks through a single cabling or
          link system. There are large economic incentives to merge the
          telephone networks with the computer network system using a single
          unified system of cabling, signal distribution, and management. ICT is
          an umbrella term that includes any communication device, encompassing
          radio, television, cell phones, computer and network hardware,
          satellite systems and so on, as well as the various services and
          appliances with them such as video conferencing and distance learning.
          ICT also includes analog technology, such as paper communication, and
          any mode that transmits communication. ICT is a broad subject and the
          concepts are evolving. It covers any product that will store,
          retrieve, manipulate, process, transmit, or receive information
          electronically in a digital form (e.g., personal computers including
          smartphones, digital television, email, or robots). Skills Framework
          for the Information Age is one of many models for describing and
          managing competencies for ICT professionals in the 21st century.
